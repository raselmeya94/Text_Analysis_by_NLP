## NLP Text Analysis Projects

Here are some project ideas for text analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP):

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Build a model to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text or a collection of reviews/comments.

- **Text Classification:** Create a classifier that can categorize text into predefined classes, such as spam detection, news categorization, or sentiment-based categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry).

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Develop a system that can identify and categorize entities like names, locations, organizations, and other relevant information in a given text.

- **Text Summarization:** Create a summarization model that can generate a concise summary of a longer piece of text.

- **Language Translation:** Implement a translation system that can translate text from one language to another.

- **Text Generation:** Train a model to generate human-like text in a specific style, such as writing poetry, generating story paragraphs, or composing song lyrics.

- **Question Answering (QA):** Create a model that can understand questions and provide relevant answers based on a given text corpus.

- **Topic Modeling:** Develop a system that can automatically extract topics or themes from a collection of documents.
